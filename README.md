BME 450 Project Proposal

# Title
	Mutli-Layer Neural Network For Predicting Patient Disease States

## Team Members
	Dean Stornello, Jordan Spradley

## Project Description: 

	Our team plans to use data sets from Kaggle that outline individualsâ€™ symptoms and disease states. The data set (Disease Symptoms and Patient Profile Dataset) consists of patient history containing age, gender, co-morbidities etc, and outline their current symptoms as well as what the diagnosis was for their particular symptom profile. Our neural network/project will be trained on this data set and be able to predict a diagnosis/disease state for an individual where the input is their demographics (age, gender, patient history) as well as their current symptoms.
